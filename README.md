# z3 issue with nuxt3

## to start
```
pnpm install
```

## run a test to see z3 is operational
```
pnpm test
```

## see it working in dev mode
```
pnpm dev
```

and issue the query 
```
curl http://localhost:3000/api/info
```
results in 
`sat`

building for production using `pnpm build` unfortunately results into a missing `z3-solver` that can be already seen because `.output/server/node_modules` does not contain `z3-solver`

important: you must leave the project as otherwise the module `z3-solver` gets loaded via node from the source project. 

```
cd /some/where/else
cp /project/z3_issue/.output .
node .output/server/index.mjs
```
and then run the same curl command as above. that results in 
```
